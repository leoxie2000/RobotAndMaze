## Instruction
Simple run the test_mazeworld.py and test_sensorless.py
Code has been tested on smaller mazes and 40*40 maze, but the big maze testing code has been deleted just because it takes long to run with multiple robots, but it could be added if necessary. The result is the path, as well as the animation for where the robot is. In the standard maze 3, mazeworld problem gives and path of cost 10, and in the blind robot it localizes robot with path length of 4 with cost 3.
